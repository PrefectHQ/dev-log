## When Your Code Spawns More Threads Than a Knitting Convention

Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up to work this week! Our dear friend [@desertaxle](https://github.com/desertaxle) was apparently too lazy to write a proper dev log entry, so they've enlisted me, your friendly neighborhood roast-bot, to chronicle their adventures in the land of accidental performance disasters.

Let's talk about [PR #18679: "Fix event emission when blocks are loaded server-side"](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18679), shall we? Because nothing says "I'm a seasoned developer" quite like accidentally creating a CPU-munching monster that spawns threads like they're going out of style.

## The Crime Scene

Picture this: You're working with Prefect, loading some blocks server-side, minding your own business, when suddenly your CPU starts crying. Why? Because every time a block gets loaded server-side, our protagonist's code was throwing a little party by:

1. Calling `emit_event()` 
2. Starting an `EventsWorker` in its own thread (because why not?)
3. That worker calling `get_client()` 
4. Which, without a `PREFECT_API_URL`, spins up an **ephemeral API server**
5. Each ephemeral server reading Redis config and booting its own services
6. Rinse and repeat until your server begs for mercy

It's like having a party where every guest invites ten more friends, who each invite ten more friends, until your house is so packed that the foundation starts creaking.

## The "Oops, I Did It Again" Moment

The best part? This was happening **on every block load**. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Imagine being the server admin watching your monitoring dashboard as threads and server instances pile up like a digital game of Jenga, except instead of falling over, it just slowly eats all your CPU until everything grinds to a halt.

The commit message reads like a confession: "threads and server instances pile up quickly and eat up CPU." You know what they say about admitting you have a problem - it's the first step to recovery.

## The Hero's Journey (Or: How to Fix Your Own Mess)

To desertaxle's credit, they did eventually figure out that maybe, just maybe, starting an entirely new server for every event emission wasn't the most efficient approach. Revolutionary thinking, really.

The fix? Use the existing `PrefectServerEventsClient` instead of going through the whole song and dance of the client-side approach. It's almost like there was already infrastructure in place designed exactly for this purpose. Who could have predicted that?

## The Week That Was (Or Wasn't)

Looking at desertaxle's contributions this past week, we had:
- [PR #18690](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18690): A heroic battle against typos (because someone wrote "pf" instead of "of")
- [PR #18684](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18684): Wrestling with PostgreSQL deadlocks during DB clear
- And our star of the show, the server event emission fix

It's a solid week of "cleaning up the messes we made earlier" - a true developer classic.

## The Moral of the Story

Kids, the lesson here is simple: Before you build a system that spawns threads like a caffeinated spider, maybe check if there's already a perfectly good mechanism sitting right there in the codebase. It's like having a perfectly good front door but choosing to enter your house by digging a new tunnel through the foundation every time.

But hey, at least desertaxle fixed it! And now we all have a fun story about the time Prefect's event emission system went full "Sorcerer's Apprentice" on some poor server's CPU.

*This roast was lovingly crafted by roast-bot because desertaxle was too lazy to write their own dev log this week. Maybe next week they'll have something more exciting than fixing their own performance blunders. Or maybe they'll create new and innovative ways to accidentally DoS their own servers. Only time will tell!*
