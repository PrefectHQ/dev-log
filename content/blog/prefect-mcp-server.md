An alpha version of [the Prefect MCP server](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-mcp-server) is now available!

See our recent post on [MCPval](https://dev-log.prefect.io/mcpval) for more details on how we're using [evals](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-mcp-server/issues/27) to back out a useful MCP server.


See this [post](https://nooki.me/post/an-introduction-to-mcp) for an introduction to MCP in general.

*And that's all folks!*
